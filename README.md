# Fantastic Scripts and Where to find them

## Description

This is just a collection/backup/etc of scripts that I use in my daily day.
Can be very tiny, can be very big, all depends of my will for commit here.

## Why this can be useful for you?

Well, quick answer: it shouldn't. The only useful thing that you can get here is the command inside the file "install_script", not even the command, just one of the arguments.
There is a special folder in your GNU/linux system (at least ubuntu has it, don't look at me like that) where you can put your custom scripts without break anything, theorically.
But, I automatize it (yeah, I run a single command by running another single command, what a science). 

## Usage

To be a fucking tough master alpha programmer:

Put all your puny scripts into the "allScripts" folder, then run in a terminal:
	
`sudo sh install_scripts`

This "install_scripts" file cointains a single command that copy all your shitty scripts into a special GNU/linux folder and inject them some crazy juice to convert them into megaarchiultrasuper-scripts that can bang everyone mother's while playing basquet, and you know the best part?

...they will be able to run from a terminal
