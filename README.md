# Fantastic Scripts and Where to find them

## Description

This is just a collection/backup/etc of scripts that I use in my daily day.
Can be very tiny, can be very big, all depends of my will for commit here.

## Why this can be useful for you?

Well, quick answer: it shouldn't. The only useful thing that you can get here are the commands inside the file "install_script".
There is a special folder that can be created in a non-invasive way in your GNU/linux system (at least in ubuntu, don't look at me like that) where you can put your custom scripts without break anything and they won't need sudo permissions, unless your scripts need it.
But, I automatize it, it's not much but it's honest work. 

## Usage

To be a fucking tough master alpha programmer:

Put all your puny scripts into the "allScripts" folder, then run in a terminal:
	
`sh install_scripts` 

(logout session, then get back in)

This "install_scripts" file cointains a single command that copy all your shitty scripts into a special GNU/linux folder and inject them some crazy juice to convert them into megaarchiultrasuper-scripts that can bang everyone mother's while playing basquet, and you know the best part?

...they will be able to run from a terminal
